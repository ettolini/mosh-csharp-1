- Declarations are similar to Java -> type name = value;

- Identifier: variable/constant name.
- Identifiers cannot start with a number.
- Identifiers can share a keyword's name if you add @ before its name -> @int

- For local variables: Camel Case -> firstName.
- For constants: Pascal Case -> FirstName.

- If you don't specify what type of real number value you're applying, the engine will think it's a double value by
  default. If this were to happen -> float number = 1.2 -> then the program would not compile, since you can't store a
  double value inside a float variable.
  floar -> f / decimal -> m / double -> default choice.
