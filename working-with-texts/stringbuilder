StringBuilder

Strings are immutable, once they're created, you cannot change their context.
On the other hand, StringBuilder is a Class defined in System.Text Namespace, which represents a mutable string.
They make it really easy to create and manipulate strings. But they aren't optimized for searching.

For example, they lack the following methods: IndexOf, LastIndexOf, Contains, StartsWith...

But instead, they provide multiple methods that are useful to manipulate strings. Such as...

Append: to add something to the end of a string.
Insert: to add something at the given index.
Remove: removes something from the string.
Replace: replaces something from the string.
Clear: clears the string element.
