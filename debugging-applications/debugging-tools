Debugging Tools

- You can click a line to put a breakpoint there, your code will stop running once you hit that point. The breakpoint will be seen as a red dot.
- You can set multiple breakpoints.
- Remember to disable breakpoints once you're done with them. They might get in the way if you were to do another test.
- There's a tool that removes them all at once in the "Run" tab.

- You can "run" your code, which is what we've been doing. Or you can "start debugging", which will trigger debugging tools at runtime.
- "F5" -> Start debuggin / "Shift + F5" -> Stop debugging

- "Step over" means jumping to the next line of code.
- "Step into" means getting into a function, where you in a line where a function call occurs.
- "Step out" means getting out of the current function, had you stepped into one before.

- "Watch Window", if you add a variable's name inside it, it'll show you it's current value. VERY USEFUL.
- "Stack Window", shows the order in which methods were run from the moment the program started, up to where you currently are.
  Where you're currently located is shown at the top, and at the bottom is where you started. If you double click any, it'll take you there.
