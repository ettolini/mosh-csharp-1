Value types
- Structures: primitive types, custom structures. Smaller types of data.
- When you declare one, they're allocated in a static location known as "stack".
- Said memory allocation is done automatically, and is also immediately removed when out of scope.

Reference types
- Classes: arrays, strings, custom classes. Larger types of data.
- When you declare one, you need to manually do the memory allocation yourself (with the New Keyword).
- Memory is allocated on heap, and is "garbage collected" by CLR. It's not done immediately, but it is automatic.
